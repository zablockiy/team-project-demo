            Calcium is an essential nutrient for strong bones and teeth, muscle
            movement, and nerve signals. Health authorities recommend getting
            enough calcium to help prevent bone fractures and osteoporosis. Milk
            offers a rich source of calcium. Manufacturers fortify cowâ€™s milk with
            vitamin D, another nutrient that benefits bone health. While calcium
            is important, not all studies agree that milk is good for preventing
            osteoporosis or fractures, as a 2019 review discusses. Due to this
            discrepancy, scientists still need to do more research.
